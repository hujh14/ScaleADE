# Scaling Image Segmentation Dataset with Active Learning

## Getting Started

My fork of Detectron lives here. Changes from the original repo are kept to a minimum.
You need to set up the ADE20k dataset as one of Detectron's datasets.

```

```

## To Do:
- ~~Train MaskRCNN from here~~
- ~~Run inference on dataset from here~~
- ~~Make sure visualization works here~~
- Evaluate accuracy of predictions
- Write simulated annotation module
- Run experiments!
- Set up AMT annotation module
- Annotate Places
