# Scaling Image Segmentation Dataset with Active Learning

## Getting Started

My fork of detectron lives here. Changes from the original repo are kept to a minimum.

```
https://github.com/hujh14/Detectron
```

## To Do:
- ~~Train MaskRCNN from here~~
- ~~Run inference on dataset from here~~
- ~~Make sure visualization works here~~
- Evaluate accuracy of predictions
- Write simulated annotation module
